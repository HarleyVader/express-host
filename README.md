# Express Host for HestiaCP with custom nginx configuration

Works with all CMS available 

## Description

This is an Express.js application that serves as a dynamic host for your directories and their subdirectories. It provides a visual interface for navigating through your file structure, with each folder and subfolder represented by an icon and a link.

When you navigate to the root URL, the application displays all of your directories and their subdirectories. If you navigate to a specific folder (e.g., "/folderName"), the application displays only that folder and its subfolders. If you navigate to a specific subfolder (e.g., "/folderName/subfolderName"), the application displays only that subfolder.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HarleyVader/express-host.git /home/<user>/web/<website>/
    ```

    Replace `<user>` with your username and `<website>` with the name of your website.

2. Navigate to the `nginx` directory in the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd /home/<user>/web/<website>/express-host/nginx
    ```

3. Change the permissions of the `nginx` directory to make install.sh executable:

    ```bash
    chmod 777 -R nginx
    chown -R <user>:<user> nginx
    ```

4. Run the `install.sh` script to create a custom `nginx.conf_port` at `/home/<user>/conf/<website>/`. If run successfully, it will create 2 files `nginx.conf_<port>` & `nginx.ssl.conf_<port>` based on the template `nginx.conf_melkanea` by replacing `<user> <port> <URL>`. It works as HestiaCP default `nginx.conf` has an include section so no need to edit anything, no need to expose certificates or use https.

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh <user> <port> <URL>
    ```

    `<URL>` is the exposed URI of where the express-host will render its content, can be anything & I love it stupid simple.

    After `install.sh` was 100% successful:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

5. Requirements to run the express-host:

    - nvm
    
        After installation, run `nvm -v` to check if installation was successful.
        
        ```bash
        nvm install node
        ```
        
        To get latest nodejs & npm versions.
        
    - pm2
    
        ```bash
        npm install pm2@latest -g
        ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the Express Host application by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
node app.js
```
Once itâ€™s running stable & you have checked it out at your <website><URL>, then close it & run PM2:
```bash
pm2 start app.js
pm2 list
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

This will start the express-host, and you can navigate to https://<website><URL> in your web browser to view your directories and their subdirectories.
